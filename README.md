# space-ship-panel-set
a group of low poly meshes built in 3DSMax for UE4. Files are in FBX format.

These meshes were created for quick mocking up of spaceship for a mobile VR build. They are not perfect in anyway and have no textures applied to them.

The screengrabs below show a build i did using them. The UV map used on most of them is the texture supplied within the UE4 sample content objects/textures.

These meshes are free to use without credit on your project.
